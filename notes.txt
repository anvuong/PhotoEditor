→ You need to accept the licences before building.

According to AndroidSDK docs you can use the following command depending on the sdkmanager location:

yes | sdkmanager --licenses
macOS : yes | sudo ~/Library/Android/sdk/tools/bin/sdkmanager --licenses

Windows: %ANDROID_HOME%/tools/bin/sdkmanager --licenses
